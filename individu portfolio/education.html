                <p>UiTM Machang is my first university that located in Machang, Kelantan. I start my journey in university in 2024. </p>
                <br>
                <p>I started my university study late because I have to work first before going to university. I choose UITM Machang is because of my mom. She is not feeling very well and alone at home. So UITM Machang is the best choice compared to the other universities. For my first semester, I got 2.98 CGPA. I am a little bit because most of my classmates got above 3 pointer. Maybe this is the time that I have to wake up to get the best pointer for the sake of my mom. üòÅ</p>
